## About DailyJournal

The idea for DailyJournal is something that I came up with a long time ago.
I wanted to create something where you can share your daily story or even more like who you are. This isnt just a place to share your story but a website to find out you're not alone.

## My plan for DailyJournal

For not I'm not planning to upload it to the public domain. Before I do so I want to add many more features that I believe will be great additions to the website.
